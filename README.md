This first completed version of the game features several functions for execution. This iteration is prior to my unerstanding of arrays and more advanced function methods and recursions.

I called the game and gameWinner functions separately as I could not figure out how to implement both simultaneously. This might have something to do with the order or use of the alert function.

I copied a loop statement from a StackOverflow search that seems to work well for the game function. I had to troubleshoot the gameWinner function as it would not display any of the return strings I wanted. To remedy this, I called the function separately after calling the game function. I'm sure there's a better way to do this efficiently.

Overall, the game works well with prompt and alert windows. The code is as concise as my current ability and understanding of JavaScript. We'll see how the next version turns out after learning more of the language.

Cheers,
Estevan
