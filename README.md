This is the revised version of the RPS game that introduces a user interface. It's very basic, but the goal was to demonstrate an understanding of DOM manipulation to reflect the results of the game.

It was a challenge for me to figure out how manipulate button choices using a forEach loop while keeping scope in mind. I was able to figure this out but will need to practice more. The next step will be to add the scores and rounds to the DOM and UI.

Right now it's not exciting to look at, but it works! I'll spend some time later on to improve the UI design and dig into some animation possibly.

Cheers,
